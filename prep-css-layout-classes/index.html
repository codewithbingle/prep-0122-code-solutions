          Lucas conceived Raiders of the Lost Ark in the early 1970s. Seeking to modernize the serial films of the early 20th-century, he developed the idea further with Kaufman, who suggested the Ark as the film's goal. Lucas eventually focused on developing his 1977 space opera Star Wars.

          The film was released to financial success but initial reviews were mixed, criticizing its darker elements and violence. However, critical opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and imagination.

During the five years between The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade, he and executive producer Lucas reviewed several scripts before accepting Jeffrey Boam's.
